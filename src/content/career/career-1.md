If you're an experienced **Chief Revenue Officer (CRO)** in software and are looking for an exciting, US-based, and fully remote opportunity, we hope you'll consider this incredible role.  You will lead our go-to-market strategy and drive revenue across all customer segments. Being able to hit the ground running, rolling up your sleeves, and being a critical part of a fast-paced culture is essential. Our technology startup is highly technical and works with the largest organizations in the world, including higher education research organizations, city and state public sector accounts, enterprises, and mid-market commercial accounts across 28 industries. You will always have one foot in our tech startup environment and the other in the enterprise and public sector environment.  You must be comfortable in both.

Overseeing Sales, Customer Success, Account Management, Sales Enablement, Marketing, and Demand Generation, you will be responsible for aligning these functions to accelerate growth and scale our business. The ideal candidate will bring a strong background in enterprise AI and high-performance computing (HPC) software technology sales, with a proven track record of building and leading high-performing revenue organizations.

As CRO, you will work closely with the CEO and executive team to shape company strategy, refine our value proposition, lead customer acquisition, retention, and expansion initiatives. This is a unique opportunity to own the full revenue engine of a technical, category-defining product and build a Series A high-growth organization.

**Responsibilities:**

- Build a revenue flywheel that will be tied to our company’s Blue Ocean Strategy.
- Lead the sales team through closing deals and teaching them how to execute on the Sales Playbook.
- Own GTM and Sales Playbooks with some of the largest tech company partners in the world.
- Develop and execute the company’s revenue strategy, aligning sales, marketing, customer success, and account management toward shared growth goals.
- Lead and scale a cross-functional GTM organization, including enterprise sales, mid-market sales, marketing, sales enablement, customer operations, and demand generation.
- Serve as a strategic advisor and executive sponsor for key enterprise accounts, particularly in industries where AI and HPC and compute-intensive workloads are core to operations.
- Translate complex technical offerings—particularly in high-performance computing, cloud infrastructure, and AI/ML workflows—into business value for enterprise decision-makers.
- Set and manage aggressive but achievable revenue, retention, and pipeline KPIs, ensuring accountability across all revenue-facing functions.
- Build and mentor high-performing teams by recruiting top talent, defining career development paths, and instilling a high-performance culture.
- Partner with Product and Engineering teams to ensure market feedback informs roadmap and new features align with customer needs.
- Guide product marketing and positioning, helping refine messaging, pricing, and packaging based on market trends and technical buyer personas.
- Oversee forecasting, pipeline management, territory planning, and resource allocation across the revenue organization.
- Act as a public-facing executive in key customer meetings, investor conversations, and industry events.

## Requirements

- 10+ years of senior leadership experience in revenue-focused roles, with 5+ years in technical B2B SaaS or infrastructure-focused companies.
- Deep understanding of compute infrastructure, AI, HPC, and technical enterprise sales.
- Proven ability to build and lead high-performing sales, marketing, and customer success teams across segments and verticals.
- Strong track record of driving consistent revenue growth and scaling GTM organizations in high-growth environments.
- Strategic thinker with the ability to move fluidly between executive-level planning and tactical execution.
- Experience with multi-stakeholder enterprise sales cycles, including technical and business stakeholders (e.g., IT, data science, procurement, C-suite).
- Familiarity with account-based marketing, sales enablement programs, and usage-based pricing models.
- Strong analytical and operational mindset, with fluency in CRM and revenue analytics tools (Salesforce & Gong).
- Excellent leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills with a track record of building alignment across diverse teams.
